The first thing to know is how searching on this website works. **E.G** You may be searching for **Oyenze**¬†or **Onye Eze** instead of **Onyenze** ‚Äì In this case you cannot get results for **ONYENZE** unless you search the correct spellings.

Avoid searching for long keywords.¬† Instead of searching for one complicated song title, **E.G** Onye Enyelu Onye Nwanne ya by **Olisadoo Onyenwe Egwu**,¬† you can simply search for **OLISADOO** ‚Äì in this sense, you will see all songs by Olisadoo , then you can look for the particular song you want.

If after following the above steps and you still cannot find the music, then contact us [**HERE**](https://wa.me/2349067945452?text=Hello%20HighLifeng!).
